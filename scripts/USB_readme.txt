For rom files to be successfully transferred using the script, the file structure of the USB must
be set up in a specific way so that the script can read it. The 'psx' folder is for PS1 games and the 
'megadrive' folder is for sega megadrive/genesis games. The games may be left in their original 
zips as the program unzips the files and stores them appropriately. 

The file structure is as shown below:
